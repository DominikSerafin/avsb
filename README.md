# avsb

AvsB is a little tool to vote between two images. You can use it to get feedback for your latest drawing/mockup/photo/UI/whatever.


## How it works

* üéé Single post (aka Comparison) consists of two images.
* üéØ You can vote only one time for each Comparison.
* üèÜ You can add your own Comparison for each 10 votes given.
* üëÄ You can see score of Comparison after you've voted on it.
* üôÖ No sign up required.



## How it works under the hood

* ES6 Modules syntax is used on the client code and CommonJS module syntax is used on server. It's mostly personal taste and the fact that Node doesn't support ES6 Modules syntax yet.
* Users are authenticated by their IP and saved to database on first entry.
* SQLite is used for database with the help of `Sequelize` an an ORM. For such a little tool SQLite should be sufficient (at least till AvsB won't gain significant traffic). There are 3 tables in the database: `users`, `comparisons` and `votes`.
* File validation is done via `mmmagic` package which reads the bytes of the file and detects the proper `Content-Type`.
* Image processing is done via `jimp` package which doesn't have any dependencies other than JavaScript. This means deploying it is easy but the image processing is slower than with the help of alternatives. In the case of AvsB (resizing image) the performance of it is sufficient. Originally I've used `sharp` package (which is blazing fast) but it couldn't compile on my $5 VPS where the AvsB is deployed due to insufficient RAM.
* Weirdly sounding slugs of Comparison are created with the help of `Moniker` package.


## Technologies / Requirements

* Node 7.6+ (need to support async/await)
* Express 4+
* Sequelize.js
* React
* React-Router
* Redux
* Webpack
* Babel
* Sass



## Server (API) structure

* `application/config/`: development and production config
* `application/extract/`: extractors (deserializers) of data queried from database
* `application/middleware/`: custom middlewares (users auth and creation is here)
* `application/migrations/`: sequelize.js migrations
* `application/models/`: sequelize.js initializations and models (to keep things simple everything is in single file - `/index.js`)
* `application/resources/`: miscellaneous resources (static, images, files)
* `application/test/`: mocha tests (not much needed really in such a small application - so it only tests if the config is alright)
* `application/util/`: utilities, helpers & abstractions
* `application/views/`: views for the routes declared in `application/index.js`



## Todo (contributions welcome)

* Implement Autotrack for Google Analytics (https://github.com/googleanalytics/autotrack)
* Infinite scroll for "Explore" page.
* Center vertically with `vertical-align` method (for IE<11) instead of Flexbox.
* If the tool will get more traction then save users to database only before they vote for first time. That will prevent database getting spammed with all the visitors not interacting with site.
* If the SQLite will be slow switch to PostgreSQL.





# Deployment

AvsB instance on serafin.io uses both server and client on the same subdomain. Server API probably should be on its own subdomain but I wanted to keep things simple in this case. Sever API is served from `/api/` subdirectory (https://avsb.serafin.io/api/) and the client from `/` (https://avsb.serafin.io/).

Also - I like to use 9xxx ports because they are most of the time unused. So in this case AvsB is deployed on 9550 port.



## Folder Structure

I like to keep things portable and in a single place. That's why repository, database, logs and media are in a single folder.

## Nginx custom log format (for sites behind Cloudflare) (`etc/nginx/nginx.conf`)

```
log_format cloudflare '[$time_local] - $remote_user - '
	                  '$remote_addr ($http_x_forwarded_for / $http_cf_connecting_ip) - '
                      '"$request" $status $bytes_sent ($gzip_ratio) - '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_referer"';
```
